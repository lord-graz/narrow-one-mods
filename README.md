# Narrow.One Customizations
#### by Lord Graz

This is just a place for me to share my Narrow.One coding creations. Usually they are custom UI CSS code or mild JS mods (only DOM modifications).

## Current public mods:
### NarrowGlass  
Pure CSS mod that makes the UI feel like glass, loosely inspired by Apple's LiquidGlass theme. Availible with the top left corner of dialogs sharp (narrowGlassSharp) or round (narrowGlassRound). The Image is a collection of screenshots from narrowGlassSharp.   
*Note: Certain parts of this mod might not work in non-WebKit (e.g. Firefox) browsers.*

### Show Item Name in Tooltip  
JS script to show the name of shop items in their stat tooltip. This can be useful if you want to switch armor/weapons midgame, but the 3D models that are needed for you to see what you are equipping load too slowly, or if you're just interested in easily seeing what the names of the shop items are :) .  
  
<img src="/img/showItemNameInTooltip.png" width="400" style="border-radius: 20vw"/>  
  
### Rotated Quad Crosshair  
A simple custom crosshair that is similar to crosshairs from other fps games. The lines still act in the same way as you would expect from a regular narrow one crosshair.
It is availible with a dot, without a dot, as JavaScript or CSS, as you prefer.  
*Note: For best results change crosshair type in the Narrow.One settings to "QUAD".*
