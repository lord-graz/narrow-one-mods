# Narrow.One Customizations
#### by Lord Graz

This is just a place for me to share my Narrow.One coding creations. Usually they are custom UI CSS code or mild JS mods (only DOM modifications).

## Current public mods:
### **NarrowGlass**  
Pure CSS mod that makes the UI feel like glass, loosely inspired by Apple's LiquidGlass theme. Availible with the top left corner of dialogs sharp (narrowGlassSharp) or round (narrowGlassRound).  
*Note: Certain parts of this mod might not work in not-WebKit () browsers.*
### **Show Item Name in Tooltip**  
JS script to show the name of shop items in their stat tooltip. This can be useful if you want to switch armor/weapons midgame, but the 3D models that are needed for you to see what you are equipping load too slowly.
