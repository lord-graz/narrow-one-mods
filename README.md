# Narrow.One Customizations
#### by Lord Graz

This is just a place for me to share my Narrow.One coding creations. Usually they are custom UI CSS code or mild JS mods (only DOM modifications).

## Current public mods:
### **NarrowGlass**  
Pure CSS mod that makes the UI feel like glass, loosely inspired by Apple's LiquidGlass theme. Availible with the top left corner of dialogs sharp (narrowGlassSharp) or round (narrowGlassRound).  
*Note: Certain parts of this mod might not work in not-WebKit () browsers.*
### **Show Item Name in Tooltip**  
JS script to show the name of shop items in their stat tooltip. This can be useful if you want to switch armor/weapons midgame, but the 3D models that are needed for you to see what you are equipping load too slowly, or if you're just interested in easily seeing what the names of the shop items are :) .
