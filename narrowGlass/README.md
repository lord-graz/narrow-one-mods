## narrowGlass  
  
Pure CSS mod that makes the UI feel like glass, loosely inspired by Apple's LiquidGlass theme. Availible with the top left corner of dialogs sharp (narrowGlassSharp) or round (narrowGlassRound). The Image is a collection of screenshots from narrowGlassSharp.  
Some parts of this mod are customizable (rounded corners, some colors, ...). Just edit the variables declared at the beginning of the file. (Not all variables are in use tho)  
*Note: Certain parts of this mod might not work in non-WebKit (e.g. Firefox) browsers.*
